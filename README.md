# Ian Lee

FPGA / RTL engineer – Zynq-7000, low-latency trading, C++ / Python (Taiwan)

## What I do

- Build FPGA pipelines (Zynq-7000) for market data → order book → trading signals
- Develop and backtest quant strategies (factor, momentum, stat arb)
- Write high-performance C++ / Python for data processing and simulation

## Selected projects

| Project | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [AX7015B FPGA Market Data → Order Book Pipeline](https://github.com/yishoulee/ax7015b-fpga-marketdata-orderbook-pipeline) | Six-stage Zynq-7015 pipeline from replayed Binance depth feed to in-FPGA order book and actions, with per-stage Vivado projects and Python tools. |
| [AlphaFoundry](https://github.com/yishoulee/alpha-foundry) | Research scaffold for alpha discovery and execution simulation: formula search, portfolio construction, and multi-period backtests. |
| [S&P 500 Factor Investing Backtest Engine](https://github.com/yishoulee/SP500-Factor-Investing-Backtest-Engine) | End-to-end factor / momentum backtester on S&P 500 with scraping, caching, and portfolio equity curve visualization. |
| [spMV Performance Benchmark](https://github.com/yishoulee/spMV-Performance-Benchmark) | Optimized sparse-matrix–vector kernel in C++ with OpenMP and cache-aware performance tuning. |
